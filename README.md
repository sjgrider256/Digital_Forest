### 📁 Training Datasets
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-The training dataset comprises images from multiple flyovers. To avoid overfitting, training data includes as much variation in lighting conditions as possible.
   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Training data categories are balanced in size so that the CNN does not favor feature learning for one category or the other. Assigning class weights can improve an imbalanced dataset, but learning will be skewed regardless if the imbalance is great enough. 
   
### 📁 Prediction Datasets
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Full dataset extracted from the GeoTIFF file included in the root directory.
